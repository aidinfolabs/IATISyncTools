## IATI Synchronisation Tools
http://www.iatistandard.org | http://www.iatiregistry.org

The goal of this project is to create a set of simple scripts that flexible and interoperably can:

* Download the latest files from the IATI registry according to some given query
* Organise these files on disk
* Process these files into different formats
* Upload the to third party services

This should provide a framework for efficient maintainence of IATI data.
